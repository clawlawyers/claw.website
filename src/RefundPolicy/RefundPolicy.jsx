        CLAW LEGALTECH PRIVATE LIMITED believes in helping its customers as far
        as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this
        policy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
          immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request
          may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
          vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
          them.
        </li>
        <li>
          CLAW LEGALTECH PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests
          for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
          refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
          quality of product delivered is not good.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the
          same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
          entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
          his own end. This should be reported within the same day of receipt of
          the products. In case you feel that the product received is not as
          shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to
          the notice of our customer service within the same day of receiving
          the product. The Customer Service Team after looking into your
          complaint will take an appropriate decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
          from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In case of any
          refunds approved by CLAW LEGALTECH PRIVATE LIMITED, itâ€™ll take 6-8
          days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
        </li>
      </ul>
